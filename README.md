# ðŸ¥² Sad Trombone â€“ Chrome Extension

Welcome to **Sad Trombone**, the browser extension you never knew you needed... until a "womp womp" sound made you feel deeply, comically seen.

This project is a whimsical tool designed to inject a little sonic drama into your web browsing. It plays a sad trombone sound (`ðŸŽº wah-wah`) on websites of your choosingâ€”because not every click deserves dignity.
